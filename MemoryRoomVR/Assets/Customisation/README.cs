    There are three class components to the system:

    1. Big Momma, known as 'CustomisationBigMoma', is the central co-ordinator for the customisation system.
    2. The Room Config class stores a named list of game objects
    3. For every room configuration that exists, an empty game object with the 'RoomConfig'script attached must exist.
