# VRMemoryRoom

#### This is an unofficial continuation of the [Viarama](https://viarama.co.uk/) Virtual Memory Room implementation, created by CS34 and CS12 of the University of Glasgow. The project is licensed under the MIT opensource license and is therefore allowed to be developed further. 

#### The initial stable builds for OS X, Linux, Windows, Oculus Quest & Quest 2 can be found at the following link, along with the entire Dekstop and VR Unity Project files, [here](https://mega.nz/folder/floywCYb#3-G_poWXRz9wm6Uyw1n8yw).

## Installation Instructions:

#### This project can be cloned and opened in the Unity Hub. 

Please refer to the attached documentation [here](https://github.com/marcaufderheyde/VRMemoryRoom/blob/main/VRMemoryRoom_Developer_Documentation.pdf) for further information about the specifics of this project.

## 360 Images of the Virtual Reality Memory Room:

You can find 360 images of the available virtual reality memory rooms [here](https://www.aufderheyde.com/360Gallery.html#vrMemoryRoom). These have been rendered from Unity and are accurate representations of the VR scene quality. The lighting is brighter in the actual version.
